# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Goal: by day 100 I will have a simple game up in the android app store.

### Day001: April 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Playing with gradients in p5js, working towards a simple interactive sufface that can sit underneath other game elements.

**Thoughts:** Working on turning my own ideas into reality feels great!!!

### Day002: April 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Playing with radial gradients in p5js, working towards a simple interactive sufface that can sit underneath other game elements. Played with adding constants to the HSB the parameters to get some weirdo bullseye effects.

**Thoughts:** Turns out p5js isn't very friendly to the CPU with dynamic gradients, dead end! :-( On the plus side I learned more about how such things are created using looping over larp() and map() :-)

### Day003: April 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Still playing with radial gradients in p5js, introduced spawning "blossom" behaviour on mouse press and release.

**Thoughts:** Learned how to measure an interval between mouseclicks.

### Day004: April 4, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Still playing with radial gradients in p5js. 
Created expanding circles for the duration of mouse press to give a more responsiveness & introduced more randomness into gradient generation to give more organic feel. Learned about the compound operator. eg: x += 4

**Thoughts:** Listening to Flying Lotus, making some wacky patterns... Fun!
