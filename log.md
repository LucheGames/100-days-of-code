# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Goal: by day 100 I will have a simple game up in the android app store.

### Day001: April 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Playing with gradients in p5js, working towards a simple interactive sufface that can sit underneath other game elements.

**Thoughts:** Working on turning my own ideas into reality feels great!!!

### Day002: April 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Playing with radial gradients in p5js, working towards a simple interactive sufface that can sit underneath other game elements. Played with adding constants to the HSB the parameters to get some weirdo bullseye effects.

**Thoughts:** Turns out p5js isn't very friendly to the CPU with dynamic gradients, dead end! :-( On the plus side I learned more about how such things are created using looping over larp() and map() :-)

### Day003: April 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Still playing with radial gradients in p5js, introduced spawning "blossom" behaviour on mouse press and release.

**Thoughts:** Learned how to measure an interval between mouseclicks.

### Day004: April 4, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Still playing with radial gradients in p5js. 
Created expanding circles for the duration of mouse press to give a more responsiveness & introduced more randomness into gradient generation to give more organic feel. Learned about the compound operator. eg: x += 4

**Thoughts:** Listening to Flying Lotus, making some wacky patterns... Fun!

### Day005: April 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Nothing sexy to report, except the code-name tomorrow's project : Disappearing Ripple!
I changed 5 projects script libraries over to a CDN, saving 5mb and potentially hundreds of future mb. You are welcome Planet Earth!

**Thoughts:** A long day, but I got it all done just ahead of the Indiana Jones rolling ball of sleepyness.



### Day006: April 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Still playing with radial gradients in p5js. 
Put in a few hours today, converting the sloppy structure of point and click to storiung the circles in an array, enabling a more generative art approach. This sets me up for future plans where I want to loop back over the array and do some disappearing animations.

I also learned more about the difference between var and let in ECMAscript.

### Day007: April 7, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Nothing concrete to show, worked through andding interactivity by looping over arrays.

**Thoughts:** A drive in Saturday: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSaO-0od2Nw



### Day008: April 8, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:  Put in a few hours today, first on https://www.codewars.com/ and then on my own circles project. I will admit that I am mostly following along with: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA_ZgruFF9k&index=28&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA right now, but I'm learnign a ton, and thats the main thing.

My circles are becoming more under control, I'm still in the dark about weather they continue to exist as vectors or bitmaps once they have been drawn over. They seem to pop off the array by themselves once drawn so I'm probably doing something noobish. Will read this article on integrating p5js and DOM elements, hopefully get some answers:
https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Beyond-the-canvas

I also learned more about the difference between foreach in js.

**Thoughts:** Still an absolute beginner: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8NZa9wYZ_U

### Day009-010: April 9-10, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:  Mainly just refactoring. I gained a new understanding of Array control and added to a stackoverflow question with a improved solution to keeping a dynamically resizing array within bounds.

**Thoughts:** Pretty fun day!

### Day011-012: April 11-12, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:  Been battling Android Studio, feels like trying to stuff the javascript toothpaste back into the java tube. Currently my app works in emulator but not on an actual device. Also got some experience refactoring all my code into one javascript closure.

**Thoughts:** #SoCloseICanFeelIt

### Day013-019: April 13-19, 2018 

**"Today's" Progress**:  Day015-016 #100DaysOfCode Finally, after years of talking about it, and five days of slog through the android dev swamp, I achieved my goal of getting an app in the app store!!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰


Its in pre-alpha testing stage which means invites only, DM me if you want an invite.

Day 017-019 #100DaysOfCode This week I read â€œHackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution" by Steven Levy which describes "the creepy feature creature", Iâ€™m also struggling to implement a feature, running into some gaps in my knowledge of arrays and how to use closures to set up loop timing.

**Thoughts:** I wish the final details would: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSM5MpKSnqE
