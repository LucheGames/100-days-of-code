# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day001: April 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Playing with gradients in p5js, working towards a simple interactive sufface that can sit underneath other game elements.

**Thoughts:** Working on turning my own ideas into reality feels great!!!

### Day002: April 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Playing with radial gradients in p5js, working towards a simple interactive sufface that can sit underneath other game elements. Played with adding constants to the HSB the parameters to get some weirdo bullseye effects.

**Thoughts:** Turns out p5js isn't very friendly to the CPU with dynamic gradients, dead end! :-( On the plus side I learned more about how such things are created using looping over larp() and map() :-)
